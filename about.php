                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Freshara was founded in 2024 by a few enthusiastic teenagers who had a burning desire
                    to make a difference in the world. It came into existence with the vision to create
                    a sustainable food marketplace in order to tackle one of the major challenges the world
                    is facing: hunger.
